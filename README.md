# PSO-Swarm-Intelligence
A modified version of particle swarm optimization (MPSO) solving an assigment problem in a reference book.

#The problem

The problem is given in the book __Programming Collective Intelligence__ by Toby Segaran, in chapter 5: Optimization. The problem is about a group travel, your task is try the best combination which gives the minimum cost (travel cost and wait time). A list of optimization methods are proposed, including Genetic Algorithms, Simulated Annealing and Hill Climbing. In this repo the Binary Discrete of Particle Swarm Optimization is proposed, and compared with Genetic Algorithms. Note: __Family members names were changed for friend names__.

# The paper

This was a scholar project, the lab report is in __report.pdf__ (spanish version).
