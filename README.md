# PSO-Swarm-Intelligence
A modified version of particle swarm optimization (MPSO) solving an assigment problem in a reference book.

# The problem

The problem is given in the book __Programming Collective Intelligence__ by Toby Segaran, in chapter 5: Optimization. The problem is about a group travel, your task is try the best combination which gives the minimum cost (travel cost and wait time). A list of optimization methods is proposed, including Genetic Algorithm, Simulated Annealing and Hill Climbing. In this repo the Binary Discrete Particle Swarm Optimization is proposed, and compared with Genetic Algorithms. Note: __Family members names were changed for some friend names just for fun, but the problem is essentialy the same__ :).

# The paper

This was a scholar project, the lab report is in __report.pdf__ (In spanish). 

# The project

The code folder contains __main.py__ this is the file where all the magic happens. __schedule.txt__ this file contains the dataset provided by the book.
